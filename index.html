<p>A paragraph is a series of related sentences developing a 
    central idea, 
    called the topic. Try to think 
    about paragraphs in terms of thematic unity:
     a paragraph is a sentence or a group of 
     sentences that supports one central, 
     unified idea. Paragraphs add one idea
      at a time to your broader argument.</p>
